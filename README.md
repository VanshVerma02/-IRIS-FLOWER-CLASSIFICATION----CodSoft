# -IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION----CodSoft
This project uses the Iris dataset to train a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on their sepal and petal measurements. It demonstrates a simple and effective approach to multi-class classification, making it a popular choice for beginners in machine learning.
